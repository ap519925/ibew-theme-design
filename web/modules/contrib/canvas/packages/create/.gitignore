# When developing this project, the app will be scaffolded inside the project
# directory. We need to ignore it otherwise initializing the app repo would fail
# given that we're already in a repository. (Plus we don't want to accidentially
# commit the scaffolded app's code.)
# This also means that you need to use the `my-canvas-app` as the app name when
# testing locally.
my-canvas-app
