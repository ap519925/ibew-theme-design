# Canvas API Documentation

## 1.0.0 Release - No Public API

**Important Notice:** The Canvas module 1.0.0 release does **not** provide any stable public APIs.

### No Public HTTP API

Canvas does not expose any public HTTP API endpoints in version 1.0.0. All HTTP endpoints are considered internal implementation details and may change without notice.

### No Public PHP API

Canvas does not provide any stable public PHP API in version 1.0.0. All PHP classes, interfaces, traits, and functions are considered internal implementation details and may change without notice.

### Future API Plans

Public HTTP and PHP APIs are targeted for the **1.1.0 release**. These will be properly documented and follow semantic versioning for backwards compatibility.

### Internal Implementation

All current Canvas code should be considered internal implementation. Classes, interfaces, and traits are annotated with `@internal` to indicate they are not part of a stable public API.
