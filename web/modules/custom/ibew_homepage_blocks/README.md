# IBEW Homepage Blocks

Creates editable homepage blocks that mirror the current front-page design and places them into the IBEW theme regions. Enable via `drush en ibew_homepage_blocks -y` or through Extend → IBEW Homepage Blocks.

Blocks created:
- Homepage Hero → region `homepage_hero`
- Homepage About → region `homepage_about`
- Homepage News → region `homepage_news`
- Homepage Events → region `homepage_events`
- Homepage Members → region `homepage_members`
- Homepage Contact → region `homepage_contact`

Each block uses the existing markup/classes so styling stays intact. Edit the block bodies at Structure → Block layout → Custom block library.
